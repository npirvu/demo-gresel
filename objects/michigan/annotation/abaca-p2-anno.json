SALEEBY, Chief, Fiber Division, Bureau of Agriculture\n\nIntroduction.-Abacá is not only the most import-\nant fiber, but also the most important export product,\nof the Philippines. For a number of years this fiber\ncomprised approximately two-thirds of the total ex-\nport trade of the Islands. The recent increase in the\nproduction of copra and sugar has reduced in a\nmeasure its relative importance, but it still remains\nour leading export product.\n\nAbacá is the premier cordage fiber of the world.\nIt is a structural (hard) fiber obtained from the\nouter layers of the overlapping leaf sheaths which\nform the stalks of the abaca plant. It is very light,\nstrong, and durable. When properly extracted and\ndried, it is also of a white, lustrous color. One par-\nticular feature of the abaca fiber which emphasizes\nits superiority over all other fibers of its class is its\ngreat strength and its resistance to the action of\nwater, hence its particular adaptability for marine\nropes.\n\nIn the commercial world this fiber is known as\n\"manila hemp\" or \"manila.\" It is often called\n\"hemp,\" especially locally by the English-speaking\ncommunity, but this term is both incorrect and mis-\nleading, and its use should be discontinued in favor\nof the Spanish-Filipino term \"abacá.\"\n\nHistory of the industry.-The first authentic ac-\ncount of the use of either abacá or banana fiber in\nthe Philippines is that given by an Englishman, Dam-\npier, who lived in Mindanao in 1686. This writer\ndescribes the \"banana textoria,\" both as an edible"
